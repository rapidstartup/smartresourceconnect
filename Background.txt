Smart Resource Connect: Technical Documentation
Architecture Overview
Smart Resource Connect is built with a modern, cloud-based architecture designed for scalability, ease of deployment, and global accessibility. At a high level, the system follows a decoupled Jamstack approach – the frontend user interface is separated from backend data services – ensuring fast performance and robust security. The platform leverages several key technologies working in harmony: Netlify for hosting and deployment, GitHub for code management, React (Next.js) for the web application, Axios for API calls, Tailwind CSS for the user interface design, Cloudflare for content delivery and security, and Supabase for the backend database and authentication services. This section outlines the role of each component and how they interact to form the Smart Resource Connect ecosystem.
Next.js Frontend (React) – The user-facing application is built with Next.js, a React-based framework. Next.js enables a hybrid of static site generation and server-side rendering, meaning pages load quickly and can be dynamically updated as needed​
DOCS.NETLIFY.COM
. This provides an intuitive web interface where organizations can list surplus resources or post needs. For non-technical readers: Next.js is essentially the "website" part, ensuring the site is responsive and user-friendly, while also being efficient for developers to build enterprise-grade applications​
DOCS.NETLIFY.COM
. The Next.js app is written in TypeScript/JavaScript (using React library) and structured for maintainability.
Netlify Deployment & Hosting – The Next.js application is deployed via Netlify, a cloud platform for automating builds and hosting static or serverless web applications. Every time developers push code changes to GitHub, Netlify automatically builds the latest version of the site and deploys it. Netlify provides a global infrastructure so that the site's static assets and any serverless functions (for dynamic features) are distributed worldwide for low-latency access. It also handles continuous integration (CI), meaning any update in the code repository can quickly go live after passing tests. Non-technical summary: Netlify makes it easy to roll out updates and keep the site running reliably without managing servers. It acts as the delivery network for the web frontend.
GitHub (Code Repository) – The project's source code is hosted on GitHub, which is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration built on Git​
ALGOCADEMY.COM
. Developers use GitHub to manage code changes, track issues, and collaborate through pull requests. In practice, GitHub ensures that multiple developers (or NGO tech teams) can work together on the codebase safely, keeping a history of changes and allowing rollbacks if needed. For decision-makers, the use of GitHub signals that the project follows open development best practices – the code is transparent and can be shared or contributed to by partners easily. Every change in GitHub can trigger Netlify to deploy a new version of the site, creating a smooth development-to-deployment pipeline.
Tailwind CSS (Design System) – The frontend uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework packed with predefined classes (like flex, pt-4, text-center, etc.) that can be composed to build any design directly in the markup​
TAILWINDCSS.COM
. This allows developers to rapidly prototype and consistently style the application without writing lots of custom CSS. In Smart Resource Connect, Tailwind ensures the interface looks clean and modern (consistent spacing, colors, and responsive layouts), while also making it easier to change the design system-wide. For non-technical readers: Tailwind helps us create a polished, mobile-friendly user interface quickly, so the platform is visually appealing and easy to navigate.
Axios (HTTP Client) – On the frontend, when the application needs to communicate with backend services, it uses Axios. Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js​
AXIOS-HTTP.COM
 – in simple terms, a tool that helps the web app send and receive data from servers through API calls. In Smart Resource Connect, Axios is used inside the Next.js app to make requests to the backend API (for example, to fetch the latest list of available surplus items or to submit a new listing). Axios handles the low-level details of these network requests and provides a convenient interface for our developers to work with data. The choice of Axios ensures reliable integration with our backend (Supabase or other REST endpoints) and good error handling and performance for data fetching. Non-technical explanation: Axios is like the messenger that safely carries information between the website and the database.
Supabase (Backend Database & Auth) – Supabase serves as the cloud backend for Smart Resource Connect. It is an open-source platform that provides a suite of tools including a PostgreSQL database, user authentication, file storage, real-time subscriptions, and even a built-in API (including GraphQL)​
DOCS.NETLIFY.COM
. In our architecture, Supabase is the central database where all data about surplus resources, demand needs, user accounts, etc., are stored securely. It also manages user authentication – when a user or partner logs in, Supabase verifies their credentials and issues a token for API access (more on this in the API section). Supabase's real-time capabilities could allow updates to propagate instantly to clients (e.g., notifying when a new match between supply and demand is found). For technical readers, Supabase essentially replaces the need to build a custom server – we use its provided RESTful endpoints and client libraries to perform CRUD operations on the data. For non-technical readers, one can think of Supabase as the cloud database and user login system behind the scenes, which is open-source (no vendor lock-in) and designed to be Firebase-like. This choice accelerates development while ensuring data is handled in a robust, scalable SQL database.
Cloudflare (CDN and Security) – Cloudflare is integrated mainly at the DNS and content delivery level to ensure the application is fast and secure for users worldwide. Cloudflare provides a global content delivery network (CDN) that caches our site's static content and serves it from servers closest to users, improving load times. It also offers security features like DDoS protection and HTTPS termination. In our stack, when a user accesses Smart Resource Connect, Cloudflare quickly directs them to the nearest Netlify edge location for the frontend content. This results in lower latency and a better user experience, even for international users. Cloudflare's focus on performance and security aligns with the project's need to be reliable for NGOs and partners globally – the platform is resilient against attacks and can handle traffic spikes. For context, Cloudflare provides a global CDN with unique performance capabilities and a strong focus on security​
CDNPLANET.COM
, which means even under heavy use or network issues, the site remains accessible. Decision-makers can be assured that the system's infrastructure is hardened and optimized at the network level.
In summary, the architecture can be visualized as follows: Developers push code to GitHub; Netlify automatically builds and deploys the Next.js frontend, distributing it via its CDN (augmented by Cloudflare for caching and DNS). The users (NGOs, companies, etc.) access the frontend in their browser, which is a fast React app styled with Tailwind. When user actions require data (like viewing listings or submitting a new entry), the frontend uses Axios to send requests to the Supabase backend or serverless API endpoints. Supabase authenticates the user (via JWT bearer tokens) and interacts with the Postgres database to return or update data. This separation of concerns means each piece (frontend, backend, deployment, database) can scale independently and can be maintained or upgraded without affecting the others. For a non-technical stakeholder, the key takeaway is that Smart Resource Connect is built with proven cloud services that ensure the platform is fast, reliable, and easy to maintain, which reduces risk and cost over time. Moreover, because the core components (React, Supabase, etc.) are open-source or standard services, the solution avoids proprietary lock-in and can be sustained or handed off in collaborative partnerships with full transparency.
API Specifications
To enable third-party developers and partner organizations to integrate with Smart Resource Connect, we provide a well-defined REST API. This API allows external systems to submit surplus listings, post resource needs (demand), and query the platform for matches between available resources and needs. In other words, any authorized partner (for example, a local NGO or a government database) can programmatically push data into Smart Resource Connect or pull data from it, fostering an ecosystem of shared resource information. This section defines the API endpoints, request/response formats, and the authentication mechanism. Both technical readers (who might implement the integration) and non-technical readers (who need to understand data sharing at a high level) will find relevant information here.
Authentication and Security (Bearer Token System)
All API endpoints are secured via a Bearer token authentication scheme. Only registered and authorized users or partner applications can access the API, ensuring that data is protected from unauthorized use. Each user (or integrating system) must first register on the platform (through the website or an onboarding process) to obtain an API token. This token is a long, encrypted string that acts as proof of authorization and identity for API calls​
DOCS.MENANDMICE.COM
. The token is typically a JWT (JSON Web Token) issued by the Supabase auth system when a user logs in or is provisioned API access.How to use the token: Every API request must include an HTTP header Authorization with the value Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>. For example:
makefile
Copy
Edit
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJI...<rest_of_token>
Using the Bearer token in the header means the server will recognize the requester's credentials and permissions​
DOCS.MENANDMICE.COM
. (In technical terms, if the token is a JWT, the backend will verify its signature and validity; if it's an API key, the system will look it up in the database.) This approach is a standard for web APIs – it eliminates the need to send usernames/passwords with each request. As a security measure, all API calls must be made over HTTPS to prevent token interception.For non-technical stakeholders: This bearer token system ensures that only trusted partners who have been given keys can send or retrieve data. If a token is compromised or needs to be revoked, it can be managed centrally. The use of standard authentication means integration is straightforward for developers and aligns with best practices (the system is as secure as the APIs of major platforms like GitHub, which also use bearer tokens for access)​

API Endpoints and Data Format
All endpoints are prefixed with an API version, for example https://api.smartresourceconnect.org/v1/... (for illustration). The API uses JSON for both requests and responses, making it language-agnostic and easy to use from any programming environment.Here are the core endpoints provided:
List Surplus Resources – GET /v1/surplus
Description: Retrieve the current list of available surplus resource listings. This endpoint returns an array of surplus items with their details. Clients can filter results by criteria via query parameters (for example, ?category=medical&location=Kenya to filter medical supplies in Kenya).
Response Example:
json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "id": "abc123",
    "title": "Excess Medical Gloves",
    "category": "Medical",
    "quantity": 10000,
    "unit": "pieces",
    "location": "Nairobi, KE",
    "availableUntil": "2025-12-31",
    "description": "Latex gloves in original packaging.",
    "provider": "HealthOrg A",
    "status": "available",
    "postedAt": "2025-03-01T10:00:00Z"
  },
  ...
]
In the above JSON, a list of objects is returned. Each object represents a surplus listing (we define the schema in the next section). Clients should page through results using standard pagination parameters (?page= or ?limit=) if the dataset is large (the API may enforce limits like 100 results per call to optimize performance).
List Demand (Needs) – GET /v1/demand
Description: Similar to the surplus endpoint, this retrieves all recorded needs or demands from organizations seeking resources. Filters can be applied (e.g., ?category=Medical to get only medical supply needs).
Response Example:
json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "id": "need789",
    "title": "Need Medical Gloves",
    "category": "Medical",
    "quantity": 5000,
    "unit": "pieces",
    "location": "Mombasa, KE",
    "neededBy": "2025-11-30",
    "description": "Hospitals in region short on gloves.",
    "requester": "HealthOrg B",
    "status": "open",
    "postedAt": "2025-03-02T08:30:00Z"
  },
  ...
]
Each demand entry has analogous fields (with some differences like neededBy date instead of availableUntil). By comparing data from surplus and demand, third parties can identify potential matches (e.g., same category and overlapping location or region).
Create a Surplus Listing – POST /v1/surplus
Description: Allows an authenticated partner to create (contribute) a new surplus resource listing. This is how external systems can push new data into Smart Resource Connect. For example, a corporation with surplus inventory could integrate their internal system to call this endpoint whenever they have excess goods to donate.
Request: The body should be a JSON object containing the required fields for a surplus item (see schema in next section). For instance:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "title": "Surplus Food Rations",
  "category": "Food",
  "quantity": 200,
  "unit": "kg",
  "location": "Perth, AU",
  "availableUntil": "2025-10-01",
  "description": "Dry food packs near expiry, suitable for immediate distribution",
  "provider": "Local Supermarket"
}
Upon success, the response will include a 201 Created status and the newly created record (with an assigned id and timestamps). Validation is performed on required fields (e.g., title cannot be empty, quantity must be a number, etc.), and the user must have a valid token.
Create a Demand Listing – POST /v1/demand
Description: Allows partners to post a new resource need. For example, an NGO could automate posting needs when their inventory drops below a threshold. The request JSON fields mirror those of a demand object:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "title": "Need Laptops for School",
  "category": "Equipment",
  "quantity": 50,
  "unit": "units",
  "location": "Lagos, NG",
  "neededBy": "2026-01-15",
  "description": "Looking for donated or low-cost laptops for educational purposes",
  "requester": "EduTech NGO"
}
The response on success will include the created demand entry with its new id.
Get Single Item (Detail) – GET /v1/surplus/{id} (and similarly /v1/demand/{id})
Description: Fetch detailed information about a specific surplus or demand entry by its unique ID. This is useful if, for example, a third-party app wants to show more info about a listing or check its current status. The response is a JSON object of the item, or a 404 if not found. (This endpoint is read-only and open to any authenticated user, since data is generally meant to be shareable.)
Matchmaking Endpoint – GET /v1/match?surplusId={id} (and/or ?demandId={id})
Description: This optional convenience endpoint returns a list of potential matches for a given listing. For example, if a partner has a surplus item and wants to find who needs it, they can call GET /v1/match?surplusId=abc123. The server will then find open demand entries that match the surplus's category and possibly location or other criteria. Conversely, ?demandId=need789 would return available surplus items that could fulfill that need.
Response Example for GET /v1/match?surplusId=abc123:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "surplusId": "abc123",
  "matches": [
    { "demandId": "need789", "score": 0.95, "overlapDetails": "Category match (Medical), Location nearby" },
    { "demandId": "need456", "score": 0.80, "overlapDetails": "Category match (Medical)" }
  ]
}
In this example, the response provides a list of matching demand IDs with a simple relevance score or explanation. Third-party developers can use this to programmatically trigger notifications or handle the logistics of connecting the supplier with the requester. (Scoring could be based on rules – exact category matches, geographic proximity, quantity sufficiency, etc. – details beyond this documentation's scope.) If there are no matches, matches may be an empty array.
Update or Close Listings – PUT /v1/surplus/{id} or PATCH /v1/surplus/{id} (and similarly for demand)
Description: Allows updating a listing's details or status. For example, marking a surplus item as "fulfilled" or updating the quantity if partially used. This ensures data stays current. Only the owner/creator of the listing (or an admin) can update it. A typical use is to set "status": "fulfilled" or "status": "closed" on a demand once it's met. The API uses standard HTTP response codes (200 for success, 401 if token is invalid, 403 if forbidden, etc.) to indicate outcome.
Authentication (Login) Endpoint – Although most integrations will use a pre-issued token, the platform could expose an endpoint like POST /v1/auth/login where a user can exchange credentials or an API key for a fresh token. This would use email/password or API key in the body and return a JWT. However, in many cases, partners might manually obtain a token from the web portal and then just use the core endpoints with that token.
Request/Response Format: All requests use JSON bodies for create/update operations and expect Content-Type: application/json. Responses are in JSON. In case of errors, the API returns a JSON with an "error" field and HTTP status codes (400 for bad input, 401 for auth error, 500 for server error, etc.). For example, a validation error might return 400 Bad Request with {"error": "Missing field: category"}.Authentication in practice: When making calls, a third-party developer will typically include code like:
js
Copy
Edit
axios.get('https://api.smartresourceconnect.org/v1/surplus', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' }
});
This attaches the bearer token in the header so the Smart Resource Connect API recognizes the requester​
DOCS.MENANDMICE.COM
. All endpoints require this header (except perhaps a public health-check endpoint or a future public feed). If the token is missing or invalid, the API will return 401 Unauthorized.By providing these endpoints, Smart Resource Connect enables seamless integration with external systems. For example, a municipal waste management system could automatically push notifications of available materials (surplus) to our platform, or an international aid coordination app could pull the data of needs and supplies to display on their own dashboard. The clear definition of endpoints and data formats ensures that developers can adopt the API with minimal friction, while the secure token system assures stakeholders that data is only shared among trusted parties.
Open Standard Documentation (Data Schema for Surplus and Demand)
Smart Resource Connect not only provides a service, but also advocates for an open standard for describing surplus resources and demand needs. By defining a common data schema, we make it easier for many organizations and platforms to share information interoperably. This section describes the structured schema for surplus data (suppliers) and demand data (needs), including JSON field definitions and best practices. The goal is that an NGO in one region and a government system in another can exchange resource data in the same format, enabling a global network of resource exchange. This documentation can be used by developers to format their data correctly, and by decision-makers to understand what information is captured and how it flows.
Surplus Resource Schema
A Surplus listing represents an available resource supply provided by some organization (or individual) that can be allocated to those in need. The JSON schema for a surplus item is structured as follows:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "string (unique identifier)",
  "title": "string (short name of the resource)",
  "description": "string (detailed information about the resource)",
  "category": "string (type of resource, e.g. Medical, Food, Equipment)",
  "quantity": "number (amount of resource available)",
  "unit": "string (unit of measurement for the quantity, e.g. kg, liters, units)",
  "location": "string (location where the resource is available)",
  "availableUntil": "string (date or date-time in ISO format until the resource is available)",
  "provider": "string (name of the providing entity, e.g. company or NGO offering the surplus)",
  "status": "string (current status: available, reserved, fulfilled, expired, etc.)",
  "postedAt": "string (timestamp when this listing was created)"
}
Field Definitions:
id: A unique identifier for the surplus listing. This is typically assigned by the system (for example, a UUID or database ID). It's used to reference the item in API calls (like retrieving or matching it). External systems should store this if they need to update or refer to the listing later.
title: A short, human-readable name for the resource item. Example: "Excess Medical Gloves" or "Spare Classroom Chairs". This helps users quickly identify the resource.
description: A longer description providing details. This might include the condition of the item, packaging, any restrictions, etc. Example: `"500 boxes of latex gloves, unopened. Located in central warehouse, can be picked up on weekdays."*
category: A classification of the resource. To enable matching, we recommend using a fixed taxonomy of categories (such as "Food", "Medical", "Equipment", "Clothing", "Shelter Materials", etc.). Consistent categories ensure that supply can be matched to demand. (If multiple categories apply, an array or comma-separated string could be used, but we suggest one primary category for simplicity.)
quantity: The amount of resource. This is a numerical value. Example: 10000 (with unit "pieces" might indicate 10,000 units of something).
unit: The unit of measurement for the quantity. Common units could be kg, liters, units, boxes, etc. This field is important for interpreting quantity and for matching (demand should ideally request in the same unit or a convertible unit).
location: Where the resource is available. This could be a city name, region, or coordinates. We recommend using a consistent format, such as "City, CountryCode" (e.g., "Nairobi, KE" for Nairobi, Kenya) or GPS coordinates if precision is needed. Location can be used for geospatial matching (finding nearby needs). It may also refer to a general region if exact address is not desired in open data.
availableUntil: The date until when the resource is available or valid. In ISO 8601 date format (YYYY-MM-DD or full timestamp). If the resource has an expiry (for perishable goods) or a deadline (after which it's no longer available), this field captures that. If open-ended, it could be null or a far-future date.
provider: The name of the organization or entity providing the surplus. This could be the donor's name (for internal tracking or to display who is offering it). Example: "HealthOrg A" or "ACME Corp". This fosters transparency and credit. However, in some cases providers might want to stay anonymous in public data; the system can allow aliasing or hiding this if necessary.
status: The current status of the listing. Possible values: "available" (default when created and open for matching), "reserved" (if a match is in process), "fulfilled" (if the surplus has been successfully allocated to a demand), "expired" (if past availableUntil or withdrawn). This field helps to filter out resources that are no longer actually available.
postedAt: Timestamp when the listing was created in the system (ISO date-time string). Useful for sorting and auditing. In an open data context, it shows data freshness.
This surplus schema is designed to be both human-readable and machine-parseable. We aim to comply with typical open data standards – for instance, all dates are ISO strings, and fields have intuitive names. An official JSON Schema definition can be provided so developers can validate their data against it. (JSON Schema is a format that enables ensuring JSON data consistency and validity​
JSON-SCHEMA.ORG
.) By using such a schema, we ensure that the data format remains consistent across different implementations, enabling interoperability at scale​
JSON-SCHEMA.ORG
.
Demand (Need) Schema
A Demand listing represents a need or request for resources from an organization. Its structure overlaps with the Surplus schema, with a few differences to account for the nature of a request:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "string (unique identifier)",
  "title": "string (short description of needed resource)",
  "description": "string (details about the need)",
  "category": "string (type of resource needed)",
  "quantity": "number (amount needed)",
  "unit": "string (unit of measurement)",
  "location": "string (location where the resource is needed)",
  "neededBy": "string (date or deadline by which the resource is needed)",
  "requester": "string (name of the requesting entity)",
  "status": "string (open, fulfilled, cancelled, etc.)",
  "postedAt": "string (timestamp when this need was posted)"
}
Field Definitions:
id: Unique identifier for the demand entry (assigned by system).
title: Brief summary of the need. Example: "Need Medical Gloves" or "Request for Textbooks". Should be concise but indicative.
description: More detailed information about the need – why it's needed, any specific requirements (e.g., "must be new or gently used"), or context. Example: `"Local clinic running low on sterile gloves due to increased patient load."*
category: The category of resource needed, using the same taxonomy as surplus if possible (so that matching is simplified – a demand for "Medical" will match surplus with "Medical"). Consistency here is crucial; we encourage aligning categories to a known list or the ones used in this platform.
quantity: How much is needed. A number value, ideally in the same units that would be provided. If unsure or if any amount helps, this could be an estimate or minimum needed.
unit: Unit of the needed quantity (e.g., kg, liters, units). Should align with how surplus is measured. If a demand can accept multiple forms (say laptops vs tablets counted in units), it might still be expressed as a single unit type for simplicity (or possibly split into multiple demand entries for each type).
location: Where the resources are needed. This could be the location of the organization or the distribution point. Format similarly as in surplus (city, country or region). If the need is broad (e.g., "nationwide"), that can be specified, but for matching, more granular location helps to pair local resources.
neededBy: The date by which the resource is required. An ISO date string. This helps prioritize urgent needs and can be used to filter out needs that are no longer relevant (past their date). If not time-bound, this could be omitted or set to a far-future date.
requester: The organization or entity requesting the resource. For instance, the name of the NGO, hospital, community group, etc. Example: "HealthOrg B" or "Springfield Refugee Center". This adds credibility and helps coordinate directly if needed.
status: Current status of the need. Possible values: "open" (actively seeking resources), "matched" or "in_progress" (a potential supplier has been found and is in process), "fulfilled" (need has been met), "cancelled" (if the need is withdrawn or circumstances changed). When a need is fulfilled or cancelled, it should ideally not show up in active queries except maybe for historical record.
postedAt: Timestamp of when the need was posted (for record and sorting).
The demand schema mirrors the surplus schema to a large degree, which is intentional – it allows straightforward comparison of fields (e.g., matching category, comparing location, etc.). This simplicity means that any system that can output data in this format can easily interface with Smart Resource Connect's API or even exchange data with other systems adopting the same schema.
Best Practices for Data Submission and Retrieval
To ensure high-quality data and effective matching, we provide the following best practices for using the above schemas:
Use Standardized Categories and Units: When submitting data (surplus or demand), always use the recommended category names and unit types. This maximizes the chance of automating matches. For example, prefer a standard term like "Medical" over a custom term "Healthcare Supplies". Similarly, use SI units or commonly accepted units. A predefined list of categories and units will be provided in the API documentation; sticking to it is highly encouraged.
Provide Clear and Concise Titles: Keep the title short but descriptive. It's the first thing other users see. Avoid internal codes or overly long titles. The detail can go into the description.
Fill Descriptions with Relevant Details: The description should cover any quality notes (new/used, condition), packaging or handling info, pickup/delivery notes, or any requirements. This helps others decide if the match is suitable. However, avoid sensitive personal data in descriptions since this data might be shared openly.
Keep Location Data Consistent: Use a consistent format for location. If possible, include country (and state if applicable). This consistency will help if we implement geolocation-based searching. For more advanced integrations, you might also include separate fields for latitude/longitude (if we extend the schema), but a text location is sufficient for now.
Timeliness: Update or remove listings as statuses change. If a surplus item is taken, update its status to "fulfilled" or remove it via the API. If a need is no longer relevant, mark it "fulfilled" or "cancelled". This avoids false positives in matching and keeps the data credible. Third-party integrators can set up webhooks or periodic checks on their data contributions to keep them in sync.
Unique IDs and References: When retrieving data, store the id of items you are interested in. This will allow you to query or update that specific item later. The IDs in our system are globally unique, and in an open standard context, they could be paired with a source identifier if aggregating from multiple platforms.
Data format: Always send JSON with proper types (strings for text, numbers for quantities). For dates like availableUntil or neededBy, use the YYYY-MM-DD format (or full timestamp if time of day matters). This avoids confusion between different date formats.
Interoperability considerations: Since this is an open standard, consider that your data might be merged with data from other sources. Avoid abbreviations or jargon in descriptions that others might not understand. And if your system has extra fields (for example, you track "contactEmail" of the provider internally), you can still use the open schema by attaching additional fields – but expect that other systems might ignore or strip unknown fields. The core fields listed above should be present for any data exchange.
By following these practices, data providers (suppliers of surplus data) and data consumers (those querying needs) can ensure that the information shared via Smart Resource Connect is accurate, useful, and easy to integrate. The open schema approach means that even outside of our platform, organizations could adopt this JSON format in bilateral exchanges or open data portals. We encourage a community-driven approach: as more stakeholders use the schema, we can collaboratively evolve it (for example, if a new field is needed for a specific sector, it can be added in a backward-compatible way).In essence, this Open Standard documentation serves as a blueprint for resource data interoperability. It defines what data points about surplus and needs should be shared. Just as JSON Schema provides a vocabulary for data consistency and interoperability​
JSON-SCHEMA.ORG
, our open schema provides a common language for sustainability and resource sharing initiatives. This reduces friction in data exchange – a critical factor when mobilizing resources quickly during crises or coordinating long-term sustainability programs.
Licensing Recommendation
To maximize adoption, collaboration, and trust, we propose an open-source licensing strategy for Smart Resource Connect that caters to the needs of non-profit organizations, government partners, and international sustainability initiatives. We want our platform's technology and standards to be freely usable and adaptable, while also protecting the spirit of open collaboration. After evaluating common licenses, we recommend a combination of licenses: one for the software/code and one for the content/schema/documentation.Software Code License – Apache License 2.0: We recommend using the Apache 2.0 License for the Smart Resource Connect codebase. Apache 2.0 is a well-recognized permissive open-source license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software with minimal restrictions​
PLANETCRUST.COM
. In other words, anyone can take our code and deploy their own instance, or incorporate parts of it into other projects, even commercial ones, without worrying about legal barriers – which is important for broad adoption. Apache 2.0 also includes an explicit grant of patent rights from contributors to users, which provides legal safety for organizations (governments and large NGOs often prefer Apache-2.0 for this reason). This license choice fosters an "equal and open developer community" because it encourages contributions (contributors know their contributions won't be mis-used or locked away) and doesn't force derivative works to open source their code (unlike copyleft licenses)​
SNYK.IO
. For decision-makers, this means investing in or adopting Smart Resource Connect carries no licensing costs or risks – it's free and open to use for any purpose, aligning with the mission to support non-profits and public good. The permissiveness of Apache 2.0 also means a for-profit tech partner could assist or integrate without licensing conflicts, which can be crucial in public-private partnerships.Open Content and Standards License – Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0): While Apache 2.0 covers the software (code) aspect, we also produce valuable content: the data schema, documentation, and potentially any open dataset of listings (if the platform's data is shared openly). For these, a Creative Commons license is appropriate. We suggest CC BY 4.0 (Attribution International) for the documentation, schema definitions, and any shared data that is not sensitive. CC BY allows anyone to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, as long as attribution is given to the creator​
CREATIVECOMMONS.ORG
. Importantly, it allows for commercial use as well​

, meaning even a private entity could use the standard or documentation – this is aligned with our inclusive approach. By using CC BY, we ensure that the knowledge base and standards we develop can propagate widely: an NGO can take our schema and include it in their own guidelines; a governmental body can incorporate our documentation in training materials – they simply need to credit Smart Resource Connect. This spreads the impact without barriers.(Why not a more restrictive CC license?) We avoid Non-Commercial (NC) or Share-Alike (SA) clauses in this recommendation because: (1) Non-commercial only (CC BY-NC) would prevent use by companies, but sometimes companies are partners in sustainability efforts (e.g., a corporation donating surplus). We don't want to accidentally exclude them from using the standard or software – and in fact, open-source definition discourages restricting by field of endeavor. (2) Share-Alike (as in CC BY-SA) would require any derivative documentation to be shared under the same terms, which is philosophically nice for openness, but can discourage incorporation into larger works (for instance, a government report might hesitate to include SA content). Apache 2.0 for code and CC BY for content together strike a balance: maximizing freedom and flexibility while ensuring credit is given.Alternative Options Considered: We did consider other licenses such as MIT (for code) or GPL family licenses. MIT is another permissive license similar to Apache 2.0 but without the patent clause – we opted for Apache 2.0 to have that extra protection and because it's equally easy for others to adopt. GPL or AGPL (strong copyleft licenses) were not chosen because they would require any modified or connected software to also be open-sourced under GPL. While that ensures openness, it can deter organizations that have some proprietary systems from integrating, which would reduce adoption in the non-profit tech ecosystem where vendors might be involved. We want to encourage even commercial service providers to adopt our platform for the sake of the mission, which a permissive license enables. For data, we also considered Creative Commons CC0 (public domain) dedication, which would allow use without even attribution; however, attribution is a reasonable requirement to maintain credit and provenance, so CC BY is preferred. In cases where data is contributed by others and might have its own licensing, we will clearly mark those. If any data should not be used commercially, that could be addressed on a case-by-case basis or via separate data-sharing agreements rather than the default license.Implications for NGOs and Partners: With Apache 2.0 and CC BY, any NGO or government agency can use the Smart Resource Connect software free of charge, modify it to their needs, or even have a contractor integrate it with their systems, without worrying about licensing fees or violations. They can also share the data schema or adapt the documentation in their training – for example, an international sustainability coalition could publish guidelines that incorporate our open standard (just crediting us). This open licensing strategy builds trust: partners know this is not a proprietary product that will lock them in or later charge them. Instead, it's a community asset. It also invites contributions: since everyone benefits from improvements, a government tech team might contribute code enhancements back to the project, or an NGO network might publish improvements to the data standard. The Apache/CC combination ensures that the ecosystem remains open and collaborative.In summary, we recommend Apache 2.0 for the code and CC BY 4.0 for documentation and schema as the optimal licensing strategy. This approach aligns with the values of transparency and inclusivity. It provides legal clarity and freedom: users can "reuse the code for nearly any purpose, including proprietary software integration"​

. This means Smart Resource Connect can become a foundational infrastructure and standard in the sustainability tech space, maintained openly by a community rather than locked to a single vendor. For the CEOs, NGO directors, and C-suite executives, this licensing model is attractive because it reduces risk (no hidden IP strings attached) and encourages investment and adoption – contributors know the platform will remain open-source, and adopters know they won't be unexpectedly restricted in how they use it to achieve their social impact goals.
